So you want to contribute, but you don't know where to start?

There's several ways you could contribute. It could be code, it could be documentation, it could be specs, it could be website maintenance, or even just feedback.

Here's some ideas to get you started:

* RDoc some classes/methods
* Contact me (ssmoot@gmail.com) about maintaining or contributing to a wiki on datamapper.org
* Give feedback and suggestions so we can discuss and possibly add them to the ta-da list mentioned in doc/TODO
* Pick a task from the ta-da list and submit some code
* Talk to me about your ideas, request commit rights on the repository and take on your own pet feature
* Improve the specs
