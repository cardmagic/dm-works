module DataMapper
  
  # An Adapter is really a Factory for three types of object,
  # so they can be selectively sub-classed where needed.
  # 
  # The first type is a Query. The Query is an object describing
  # the database-specific operations we wish to perform, in an
  # abstract manner. For example: While most if not all databases
  # support a mechanism for limiting the size of results returned,
  # some use a "LIMIT" keyword, while others use a "TOP" keyword.
  # We can set a SelectStatement#limit field then, and allow
  # the adapter to override the underlying SQL generated.
  # Refer to DataMapper::Queries.
  # 
  # The second type provided by the Adapter is a DataMapper::Connection.
  # This allows us to execute queries and return results in a clear and
  # uniform manner we can use throughout the DataMapper.
  #
  # The final type provided is a DataMapper::Transaction.
  # Transactions are duck-typed Connections that span multiple queries.
  #
  # Note: It is assumed that the Adapter implements it's own
  # ConnectionPool if any since some libraries implement their own at
  # a low-level, and it wouldn't make sense to pay a performance
  # cost twice by implementing a secondary pool in the DataMapper itself.
  # If the library being adapted does not provide such functionality,
  # DataMapper::Support::ConnectionPool can be used.
  module Adapters
      
    # You must inherit from the SqlAdapter, and implement the
    # required methods to adapt a database library for use with the DataMapper.
    #
    # NOTE: By inheriting from SqlAdapter, you get a copy of all the
    # standard sub-modules (Quoting, Coersion and Queries) in your own Adapter.
    # You can extend and overwrite these copies without affecting the originals.
