=== 0.1.0
Initial Release

=== 0.2.0
"Statement" to "Command" refactoring to support a wider potential
range of backing stores, and solve some tricky issues around
queries that return rows that can materialize several objects at once.
That work will bring with it HasAndBelongsToManyAssociation support.
I also hope to have initial support for PostgreSQL.

=== 0.3.0
The goal for this release is to fill in missing save-chaining,
callbacks, validations, documentation, etc so that this is the first
"production-ready" release.

=== 0.4.0
Now that the feature-set should be 90% competitive with ActiveRecord,
this release will focus on profiling and performance enhancements,
which there should be a lot of opportunity for.
